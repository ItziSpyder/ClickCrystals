## Scripting Now Has a Wiki!

Want to script custom modules but don't know how to script? 
Don't worry, there's a full guide on how to create your own custom scripts and modules!

## But isn't this cheating?
It is not a cheat. It does not automate any task, for every action the mod preforms, you have to click.
- This mod is not a macro, it does not click for you. It functions as a hotkey for slots.
